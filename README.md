Quantitative Methods for Discourse Linguistic Perspectives  

## Overview  
This documentation provides an overview of the two main folders `topic_modeling` and `twec`, each covering different aspects of data analysis. Each folder contains specific scripts and resources required for the respective processes.  

## Folder Structure  

### 1. `topic_modeling`  
This folder contains scripts and models for topic modeling, a method for identifying topics in large text collections.  

**Contents:**  
- A BERTopic script optimized for discourse linguistic research questions.  
- Further information can be found on Maarten Grootendorstâ€™s [GitHub page](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html).  

### 2. `twec`  
The `twec` folder focuses on the application of Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass (TWEC), a method for analyzing word meanings over time. [TWEC Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02142.pdf)  

**Contents:**  
- **TWEC Scripts:** Scripts for training TWEC models, largely based on the following script: [TWEC](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/zukoko/sommerschule-2023/-/tree/master/C5-Distributionelle-Semantik/TWEC_Clustering?ref_type=heads).  
- **Data Handling:** Tools for importing and preparing datasets for TWEC.  
- **Model Analysis:** Scripts for examining and interpreting the generated word embeddings.  
- **Visualization:** Tools for graphically representing the results, e.g., through vector space diagrams.  

## Usage Notes  
- **Dependency Installation:** Ensure all required libraries are installed. The necessary libraries are listed in the respective subfolders.  
- **Script Adaptation:** Adjust the scripts to your specific data and requirements.  
- **Documentation:** Each folder contains a dedicated README file with more detailed instructions and information.  

## Additional Resources  
Additional resources and examples can be found in the respective subfolders. For a more comprehensive guide and best practices, refer to the included documentation and external sources.
